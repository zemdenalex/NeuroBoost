/**
 * Moving an event to another calendar, through the editor a person actually uses.
 *
 * 🔴 Why this exists. Denis reported on 10.09 that an event "saves" and does not
 * move, and reading the code produced two confident wrong answers before a
 * browser produced the right one: `handleSave` in `useEditorForm.ts` omitted
 * `calendarId` from its `useCallback` deps, so changing ONLY the calendar left
 * the callback closed over a stale value. It computed `calendarChanged = false`,
 * deleted the field from the body, and sent a PATCH the server had nothing to do
 * with. HTTP 200, nothing moved.
 *
 * Everything that could have caught it, didn't:
 * - the server is fine, and answers 200 either way — proved separately over
 *   plain HTTP before this test existed;
 * - `api/index.ts` maps `calendarId` → `calendar_id` correctly, and a unit test
 *   on that mapping passes while the field never arrives;
 * - ESLint named the missing dependency, by file and line, on every CI run.
 *   Warnings do not fail the build, so it was counted and never read.
 *
 * The only control that could have failed for the right reason is this one: a
 * real editor, a change to the calendar and NOTHING else, and an assertion
 * against the API rather than against the screen.
 *
 * 🔴 The "and nothing else" is the whole test. Changing the calendar together
 * with the title passes even with the defect present — the title IS in the deps,
 * so the callback is rebuilt and picks the calendar up on the way. A test that
 * edits two fields is the test that could not fail.
