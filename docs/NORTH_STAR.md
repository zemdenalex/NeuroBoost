# NeuroBoost — North Star

 > Purpose (emotional):

 In a world where attention is a commodity and short‑form content, ads and subscriptions compete for our every waking moment, it is almost impossible to stay focused on what truly matters.  NeuroBoost is the antidote: a place to reclaim your mind.  It is for those who know their goals but struggle in the moment — neurodivergent folks, students, freelancers — anyone who wants to trade chaos for clarity.  With just a small assist, you push yourself to do what your future self will thank you for.  You schedule what matters, track what you actually did, and reflect honestly.

 AI can help, but it is not the hero of the story.  It is a quiet partner that learns your patterns and surfaces timely suggestions without hijacking your agency.  The long‑term vision is an “everything planner” — not that it replaces every other app, but that you never need another planner or to‑do list.  It integrates with the tools you already use, filters noise, and gradually helps you reduce unneeded apps, entertainment, and distractions.

> Crisp promise:

- **Calendar‑first, task‑smart** planning.  
- **Respectful nudges** based on your time, energy, and context.  
- **Truthful reflections** that align plan vs. actual.

This file anchors tone and intent. Any change that weakens these pillars should be reconsidered.
